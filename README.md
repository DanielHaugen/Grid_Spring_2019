# Grid_Spring_2019
* __Purpose__
  * Created for the UNG Engineering Club. A GUI initially designed to be implemented as a grid for defining object locations 
  in hopes of integrating with an autonomously maneuvering robot for our entry into the 2019 ASEE Model Design Comptetition.
* __Goal__
  * The goal was to design an interface for positioning objects that would be found on the grid during the competition. These objects include
  the hospital, shelter, and the fire which are all always located in the same position on the grid, and thus fixed in location on the grid.
  Additionally, the user is capable of placing the three red (injured) pins, four naturally wood colored (unharmed) pins, and three obstacles
  in their randomized locations along the grid.

* ## Example Grid provided

* __Further Explanation__
  * The program is initialized in its "collapsed state", which essentially just means there is a text field area which is hidden and 
  unaccessable in its current state. Clicking the "Expand" button in the bottom right will display the extra section of the window for
  utilization.
